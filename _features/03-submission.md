### Inclusion Support and Early Feedback

This year we're making extra efforts to include a more diverse range of ACMC artists and scholars. 

We understand that submitting to an academic conference can be intimidating, so if you need some extra support navigating submission, we are here to help! 
Up until 28 February we are able to give feedback on draft submissions, particularly from those outside of academic/mainstream institutions.
If this applies to you, get in touch over email ([conference@computermusic.org.au](conference@computermusic.org.au)) with your draft submission and we will arrange feedback from one of the committee members. 
Your submission will not be reviewed by anyone who has given feedback through this arrangement.

After submissions are reviewed there will be a call for inclusion support for contributors who might have difficulty attending the conference.
Selection will be by the conference committee and prioritise contributors with an accepted submission who would not be able to attend without extra support. 
The details of this call are to be advised over the coming weeks.
