**NB: Submissions are extended to 23:59 Monday 16/3/2020 (anywhere on earth)**

The **Australasian Computer Music Conference** will take place at the
**Australian National University, Canberra**, from **July 8-11, 2020**. ACMC is
the annual gathering of the [Australasian Computer Music
Association](https://computermusic.org.au), a place to show and
discuss research and artistic progress in computer/electronic music. It's a
festival of performances, installations, workshops, and tutorials that inspire,
challenge, and showcase our community.

This year’s conference theme is **inclusion**. We want to highlight the diverse
range of people who contribute to Australia’s computer/electronic music culture
but may not normally attend an academic conference, including artists and
scholars who are young/emerging, from regional/remote areas, who have a
disability, who are First Nations People, who have low/no income, who are
engaged in community music making, or who simply work outside of academia and
mainstream institutions.

As part of these efforts, we now invite submissions with the
opportunity to **receive feedback** and **engage in conversation**
with all interested participants. Submissions should be made through
the EasyChair conference system, but questions or ideas over email
([conference@computermusic.org.au](conference@computermusic.org.au))
or to the individual organisers (listed below) are welcome!

Please note that multiple submissions (e.g., a performance, an artist
talk, and a workshop) are possible and encouraged.

Registration fees are to be confirmed, but we are committed to
providing low/no-cost access to ACMC for those who find that cost is a
barrier for participation.

Looking forward to your submissions!
