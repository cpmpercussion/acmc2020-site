Due to the current COVID-19 situation the ACMC 2020 committee has decided to
cancel this year's conference as an in-person event. We were really looking
forward to seeing you all in July, but the uncertainty around what things will
look like by then means that we feel this is the best decision.

We are currently considering options for hosting the conference in an online
format which will still provide a diverse and inclusive showcase of high quality
presentations, performances and workshops. If you submitted a proposal (e.g.
paper, artist talk, performance) to the conference we’ll be in touch ASAP with
more details about what that looks like.

Stay safe, wash your hands regularly, and keep the dates of July 8--11 in your
diary for now---we’ll provide an update on what's happening as soon as we can.

The **Australasian Computer Music Conference** will take place ~~at the
**Australian National University, Canberra**~~, from **July 8-11, 2020**. ACMC
is the annual gathering of the [Australasian Computer Music
Association](https://computermusic.org.au), a place to show and discuss research
and artistic progress in computer/electronic music. It's a festival of
performances, installations, workshops, and tutorials that inspire, challenge,
and showcase our community.

This year’s conference theme is **inclusion**. We want to highlight the diverse
range of people who contribute to Australia’s computer/electronic music culture
but may not normally attend an academic conference, including artists and
scholars who are young/emerging, from regional/remote areas, who have a
disability, who are First Nations People, who have low/no income, who are
engaged in community music making, or who simply work outside of academia and
mainstream institutions.

As part of these efforts, we now invite submissions with the
opportunity to **receive feedback** and **engage in conversation**
with all interested participants. Submissions should be made through
the EasyChair conference system, but questions or ideas over email
([conference@computermusic.org.au](conference@computermusic.org.au))
or to the individual organisers (listed below) are welcome!

Please note that multiple submissions (e.g., a performance, an artist
talk, and a workshop) are possible and encouraged.

Registration fees are to be confirmed, but we are committed to
providing low/no-cost access to ACMC for those who find that cost is a
barrier for participation.

Looking forward to your submissions!

_Ben Swift, Charles Martin, Nat Grant, Alexander Hunter, Kit Devine, Sia Ahmad (ACMC committee)_
