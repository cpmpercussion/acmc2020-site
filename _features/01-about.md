The **Australasian Computer Music Conference** will take place at the **Australian National University, Canberra**, from **July 8-11, 2020**. ACMC is the annual gathering of the [Australasian Computer Music Association](https://computermusic.org.au) to discuss research and artistic progress in computer/electronic music, and a festival of performances, installations, workshops, and tutorials that inspire, challenge, and showcase our community.

This year’s conference theme is **inclusion** and we want to highlight the diverse range of people who contribute to Australia’s computer/electronic music culture, but may not normally attend an academic conference. This could include artists and scholars who are **young/emerging**, from **regional/remote areas**, who have a **disability**, who are **First Nations People**, who have **low/no income**, who are engaged in **community music making**, or who simply work **outside** of academia and mainstream institutions.

As part of these efforts, we will have an **early call for contributions open from 15 December 2019** with the opportunity to **provide feedback** and **engage in conversation** with artists and scholars who may not normally attend. Further calls will be published in 2020.

We are committed to providing low/no-cost access to ACMC for those who find that cost is a barrier for participation.

Submissions should be made through the EasyChair conference system, but questions or ideas over email ([acmc@computermusic.org.au](acmc@computermusic.org.au)) or to the individual organisers (listed below) are welcome!

Please note that multiple submissions (e.g., a performance, an artist talk, and a workshop) are possible and encouraged.

Looking forward to your submissions!
