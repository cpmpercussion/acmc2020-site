Meet the ACMC Committee! We're a group of academics and artists committed to building an inclusive computer music scene in Canberra and Australia. We come from a variety of countries and disciplines. Although most of us work in universities, we also have experience as artists, orchestral musicians, music teachers, programmers, and elsewhere.

- [Ben Swift](https://benswift.me) - General Chair
- [Nat Grant](http://www.natgrantmusic.com) - Inclusion Chair 
- [Charles Martin](https://charlesmartin.com.au) - Paper and Artist Talk Chair
- [Kit Devine](http://kitdevine.com) - Installation and Visuals Chair
- [Alexander Hunter](https://www.alexanderhunter.com.au) - Music and Performance Chair

We're responsible for organising ACMC2020 and selecting the program, but we rely on a team of reviewers to evaluate submissions fairly. **If you want to be a reviewer for ACMC -- get in touch!**
